# Kandinsky_Circles
This is the Kandinsky Circles Project. It was inspired by Wassily Kandinsky.
Wassily Kandinsky was one of the famoust Abstract Painters. He wrote the
important Book Point to Line to Surface. In this Book he discussed the Elements
of Abstract Art. He explained here the basic Shapes Rectangle Triangle, and of
course the Circle. The Circle is in this Project the Object of interest. The
Circle has an special Aspect as he can been seen as an expanded Point. A Point
in Art is never a mathematical Point. He has ever a Expansion, so he will become
a Circle. But each Circle consist even out of Points. So a hirarchical System is
builded up. At the start of this hirarchical System is the whole Canvas - and to
say it in terms of Computer Art - at the lowerst side stands the Pixel.
In this Project I have for the first wrote a Set of Programs which creates such
a Set of Circle Hirarchies.
